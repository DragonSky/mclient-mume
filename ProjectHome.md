mClient is a new, single-solution mud client that merges the previously separate client and mapper together in order to create a powerful, easy to use, and highly modern mud client. mClient is written in the Qt4 framework and was inspired by the mud client powwow and mappers MMapper2 and Pandora.

### Features ###
  * Highly modular plugin-based design
  * Portable to Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X
  * Actions, aliases, and scripting (Javascript)
  * Built-in mapper based upon MMapper
  * WebKit-based display (requires >=Qt 4.6)

### Features to be added ###
  * Powwow scripting and MUME remote editing
    1. `<pager>` tags will hopefully be added to MUME to make remote editing easier
    1. Powwow scripting support is somewhat possible through the proxymanagerio
  * Group manager similar to MMapper2/Pandora
    1. Still not possible as we need to adjust the mapper architecture some

### What is MUME? ###
MUME is a free multiplayer roleplaying game based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth that has been continuously enhanced since fall '91. In MUME players can explore and live in this meticulously crafted world during its late Third Age, and possibly join the epic War between the forces of the Dark Lord and the armies of the West. The action takes place before The Hobbit and after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key of Erebor was just found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.
