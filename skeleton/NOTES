Flow of data:
============

MUME side                                              client side
InputPlugin -> FilterPlugin -> ... -> FilterPlugin -> OutputPlugin
            /                 \                        \
InputPlugin                    OutputPlugin             OutputPlugin


InputPlugins have a list of QObject subscribers,
FilterPlugins have a list of OObject subscribers and a QObject source,
OutputPlugins only have a QObject source.

InputPlugins start the chain, but OutputPlugins can connect anywhere.

InputPlugins get data from somewhere, be it a widget or a proxy, and pass it
on via QEvents.  The function that passes on the data can be a slot called by
signals on e.g. socket receiving data, or user input in the input bar.
InputPlugins can listen to a proxy for user input, or to the MUME socket.

Output plugins take data and do something with it.  This something can be
sending it to a socket (by connecting as a source)
