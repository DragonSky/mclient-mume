"You can buy:" initiates what follows.

For each line of input:
Tokenize the string, using ' ' as a separater.

If the first token is a number followed by a period (1.), parse it.
Otherwise, continue.

The second token will be either 'a' or 'an', or a number word.  Number words
should be turned into ints and stored.

The next X tokens will be the item name.  Put those into a string, until
running into a token like 'up' or 'for'.

The string beginning with 'up' or 'for' is the cost.  If 'for' is found, the
rest of the line is the price, and it contains number words that should be
stored as ints (anything that isn't 'gold', 'silver', 'copper', 'lauren',
'caleb', 'busc').  If 'up' is found, then the next will be 'to', after which
are the number words for the price.
